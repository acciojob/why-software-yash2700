	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>There's nothing more satisfying than solving a problem that's been around for a while and nobody else knows how to solve. As a Software Developer you constantly provide solutions for users' problems. You can be working on the occasional quick fix as well as more complex strategic solutions.</p>
